## LanserMenu : Megabonk Hack / modmenu (the most OP one yet)

**LanserMenu** is a custom mod menu developed for the game **MegaBonk**, built to provide powerful gameplay modifications with stability and ease of use.
The menu was **tested on game version 1.0.49**. It may or may not work on other versions, so using the tested version is strongly recommended for the best experience.

### Features

* **GOD MODE**
* **FLY**
* **XP Teleport**
* **Ghost Army Spawn**

LanserMenu includes **automatic saving of keybinds and settings**, so your configurations are preserved between game sessions.

### Future Updates

New features can be added in the future when time is available.
You can request new functions at any time — **literally any feature is possible to implement**.
The menu can be actively maintained and updated based on user feedback.

### Requirements

* **MelonLoader**

### Installation Guide

1. Download and install **MelonLoader**.
2. Select **MegaBonk** from the game list shown by MelonLoader, or manually select the game executable from its folder.
3. Run the game and wait until MelonLoader finishes creating all required files.
4. Close the game and place the **LanserMenu DLL** into the `Mods` folder.
5. Run the game again.

**Done.**

### Controls

* Press **F1** to open the menu.
